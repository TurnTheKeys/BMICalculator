# BMI calculator
## How I worked on this project
- I wanted to code something simple to learn how to code in Rust
- I wrote code that would follow the steps that would accept measurements and measurement types to calculate BMI

## How to navigate this project
- All the code is in _BMICalculator/bmi_calculator/src/main.rs_
- To run code:
 - Download file [link](https://github.com/TurnTheKeys/BMICalculator/blob/main/bmi_calculator/target/debug/) called bmi_waist.exe, and navigate to it through cmd
 - Navigate to the file using cmd (on windows)
 - Type in '.\bmi_waist.exe' to run code

## Why I built the project this way
- Creating a BMI calculator would allow me to use the concepts I had learned from Rust resources
- By coding a BMI calculator, I could use the basic concepts of rust such as accepting user inputs, working with variables as well as writing functions

## If I had more time I would change this
- Make the code more streamlined to avoid repetitive code
- Introduce additional functions such as descriptions based on additional given measurements such as waistline
